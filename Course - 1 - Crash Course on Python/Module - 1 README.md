# Python Key Concepts for Automation 01

## Knowledge Areas

- **Benefits of Python**: Simple, readable, versatile, cross-platform, and widely used in automation, data science, web, and more.
- **Comparison to Other Languages**: Python is easier to learn and write; other languages like C, C++, Java are more verbose.
- **Learning Multiple Languages**: Mastering one programming language helps in understanding others due to shared principles like variables, loops, and logic.
- **Automation**: Using scripts to replace manual tasks – reduces time, increases accuracy.
- **Syntax in Python**: Crucial to write precise code – Python is case-sensitive and sensitive to indentation and punctuation.
- **Semantics in Python**: The meaning or effect of code when it runs – what it actually does when executed, as opposed to syntax.
- **Functions and Keywords**: `print()` is a common function; keywords include `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `def`, `return`.

## Glossary Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Automation** | Replacing manual steps with automatic ones |
| **Function** | Reusable block of code for a task |
| **Syntax** | Structure and rules of code |
| **Semantics** | Meaning or effect of code statements |
| **Logic Errors** | Errors that cause incorrect behavior |
| **Script** | Small programs for automation |
| **Programming Language** | Language for writing instructions (e.g., Python) |
| **Interpreter** | Executes code line-by-line |
| **Variable** | Stores a changeable value |

## Coding Skills

### Printing
```python
print("I love Python!")
print(360)
value = 8 * 6
print(value)
```
---

# Arithmetic
```print(3 * 8 / 2 + 5 - 1)      # Basic arithmetic
print(4 ** 6)                 # Exponentiation
print(4 ** 0.5)               # Square root
```

# Variables
```years = 10
weeks_in_a_year = 52
weeks_in_a_decade = years * weeks_in_a_year
print(weeks_in_a_decade)     # Outputs: 520
```

# Password Combinations
```
print(10 ** 3)  # 3-digit passcode combinations = 1000
```

# Data Usage Calculation
```download_size_kb = 200 * 1024
total_computers = 200
total_kbs = download_size_kb * total_computers
print(total_kbs)  # Outputs: 40960000.0
```

# Sample Logic

- **Why be precise?**
  - Computers do exactly what you tell them.

- **What’s automation?**
  - Replacing manual work with scripts.

- **Syntax vs Semantics?**
  - Syntax is how code is written; semantics is what it means.

- **Python Traits?**
  - Cross-platform, beginner-friendly, general-purpose.
